				<h1>WHO Nomenclature of COVID-19</h1>
<p>WHO classification is based on the Amino acid sequence of the spike protein on the surface of the virus. The spike protein is the one that attaches to receptor in host. Spike protein has 1273 AA, divided among 3 protein molecule. When we name a variant as E484Q, it means at 484th position of spike protein E or glutamate is mutated to K or Lysine. Depending on the charge and size of the mutated protein, it might be able to evade the antibodies this way.</p>
<p>Alpha variant had 23 such mutations.</p>
