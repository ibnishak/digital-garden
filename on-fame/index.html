				<h1>On fame</h1>
<p>Almost everything attributed to fame is actually a function of wealth. If you wealth is a function of your fame, like being an artist or actor, chase fame. Otherwise fame brings nothing to the table but woes. Fame kills you privacy and puts a very visible target on you. Posthumous fame is even more worthless as it does nothing for the person in question. Yearning for fame dilutes your internal integrity by corrupting your intentions behind doing good work.</p>
