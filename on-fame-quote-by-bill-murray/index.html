				<h1>On fame-Quote by Bill Murray</h1>
<p>&quot;I always want to say to people who want to be rich and famous: ‘try being rich first.’ See if that doesn’t cover most of it. There’s not much downside to being rich, other than paying taxes and having your relatives ask you for money. But when you become famous, you end up with a 24-hour job.&quot; - Bill Murray</p>
