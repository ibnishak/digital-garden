				<h1>True meaning of freedom</h1>
<p>In 1959 (or 1960?) during the UN General Assembly annual meeting, Eisenhower first went up to give his speech. He said:</p>
<p>&quot;Americans know the meaning of true freedom. If someone went to the centre of the Times Square and shouted &quot;The US President is a fool&quot;, he would go away scot-free and maybe even gain a few supporters.&quot;</p>
<p>On hearing this, Khurschev, whose turn was after Eisenhower's, said:</p>
<p>&quot;Well I don't know about freedom, but if someone went to the centre of the Red Square and shouted &quot;The US President is a fool&quot;, he would not only go away scot-free, but even be rewarded with state honors! &quot;</p>
