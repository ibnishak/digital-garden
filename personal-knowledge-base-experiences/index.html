<ul>
<li>Keep the tools and data in simplest forms possible. The interactions with them can be complex.</li>
<li>Avoid folders. It makes linking difficult and puts data into silos.</li>
<li>Indexes are important to get a birds eye view. Indexes should also be used to create proper hierarchy among notes instead of folders.</li>
<li>Indexes should come first in filesystem
<ul>
<li>Filesystem is inefficient because of the limited ability to sort notes, resulting in separation of related notes. Deliberate naming of files using numbers is hard to revise in case of insertion of new notes in between. However previous attempts at zettelkasten prove that filesystem cannot be ignored entirely either due to the simple fact that it is universal. The compromise is to ensure that indexes appear first in filesystem by virtue of the fact that their names start with digits (eg:001-zettelkasten)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Indexes should be excluded from zettelkasten graphs. Graphs should only show relations <strong>independent of indexes</strong>. This can be reasonably achieved using local graphs. Exclusion of indexes from global graphs can provide new insights by removing the noise of vertices created by indexes.</li>
<li>Manage indexes manually. The advantage of zettelkasten comes from interacting with notes. Automation runs the risk of reducing interactions.</li>
<li>Tags are yet to be found useful. Already notes are connected via links and indexes. I did not find the need for a third layer of connections.</li>
