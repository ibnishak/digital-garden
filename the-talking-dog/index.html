                    <h1>The talking dog</h1>
<p>A guy walks into a bar, and tells the bartender he owns a talking dog. The bartender, of course, is skeptical, and says:</p>
<p>&quot;There is no way you have a talking dog.&quot;</p>
<p>The guy replies, &quot;Oh yeah? I bet you ten thousand dollars I can bring my dog in and he will talk.&quot;</p>
<p>The bartender was taken aback, and more skeptical than ever, but shrugged and thought it an easy way to make ten thousand dollars. &quot;Okay,&quot; said the bartender, &quot;but if you bring a dog in here and it doesn't talk, I get to throw you and the dog out the window of my bar.&quot;</p>
<p>The two men shake hands, and the guy leaves the bar. he comes back in a moment later with a big yellow lab on a leash. He takes the dog up to the bar and puts him on a stool. He turns to the dog and says, &quot;Now dog, what is that thing called that is the top part of a house?&quot;</p>
<p>The dog promptly replies &quot;WRROOF!&quot; The bartender says &quot;No no no, that doesn't count. Ask him another question.&quot;</p>
<p>The guy turns to the dog and says, &quot;Now dog, what is the top part of your mouth called?&quot; Once more, the dog responds with a booming &quot;WRROOF!&quot;</p>
<p>The bartender is getting agitated now. &quot;Ask the damn dog a real question or quit wasting my time!&quot;</p>
<p>So the guy turns to the dog a third time and says, &quot;Now dog, who was the greatest baseball player of all time?&quot; The dog immediately responds, &quot;WRROOF!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That DOES it!&quot; says the bartender, now very angry. Without even asking the guy for the ten thousand dollars first, he picks the guy up and throws him out ofthe window of the bar. He picks the dog up and throws him also out of the window of the bar. So the guy and the dog are dusting themselves off in the parking lot, and the guy turns to the dog and the dog turns to the guy, and the dog says, &quot;Do you think I should have said DiMaggio?&quot;</p>
