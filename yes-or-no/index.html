                    <h1>Yes or no</h1>
<p>In a press conference, a journalist questioned posed a diificult question to a Politician. The politician, in true political style, answered the question in a long winding manner.</p>
<p>The journalist, perhaps an impatient rookie, stressed on a yes or no, for his question. And politician continued to add an explanation instead of a direct yes or no. At which stage the journalist lost his cool and shouted - &quot;I need a yes or no&quot;.</p>
<p>The politician took a moment and replied, &quot;Every question cannot have a yes or no response&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes it can. Every question can have a yes or no - if asked in the right manner, which I have&quot;, responded the journalist.</p>
<p>&quot;Alright. In that case - have you stopped beating your wife?&quot;</p>
