                    <h1>Post-retirement life</h1>
<p>After my retirement, I looked forward to some relaxation time and putting my feet up, but my wife had other ideas</p>
<p>... she insisted I take her to the local shopping centre every day.</p>
<p>Like most men, I found shopping boring and preferred to get in and out.</p>
<p>She's like most women - loves to browse &amp; leaves me with endless time to fulfill.</p>
<p>Yesterday my dear wife received the following letter,<br>
from the local Shopping centre:</p>
<p>Dear Mrs. Harris:</p>
<p>Over the past six months, your husband has caused quite a commotion, in our store.</p>
<p>We cannot tolerate this behavior and have been forced to, ban both of you from the store.</p>
<p>Our complaints against your husband, Mr. Harris, are listed below and are documented by our video surveillance cameras:</p>
<p>June 15: He took 24 boxes of condoms and randomly put them in other people's carts when they weren't looking.</p>
<p>July 2: Set all the alarm clocks in Housewares to go off at 5-minute intervals.</p>
<p>July 7: He made a trail of tomato juice on the floor leading to the women's restroom.</p>
<p>July 19: Walked up to an employee and told her in an official voice,<br>
'Code 3 in House wares. Get on it right away'.<br>
This caused the employee to leave her assigned station and receive a reprimand from her Supervisor that in turn resulted with a union grievance, causing management to lose time; and costing the company money. We don't have a Code 3.</p>
<p>August 4: Went to the Service Desk and tried to put a bag of M&amp;Ms on layaway.</p>
<p>August 14: Moved a, 'CAUTION - WET FLOOR' sign to a carpeted area.</p>
<p>August 15: Set up a tent in the camping department and told the children shoppers he'd invite them in if they would bring pillows and blankets from the bedding department to which twenty children obliged.</p>
<p>August 23: When a clerk asked if they could help him he began crying and screamed, 'Why can't you people just leave me alone'<br>
EMTs were called.</p>
<p>September 4: Looked right into the security camera and used it as a mirror while he picked his nose.</p>
<p>September 10: While handling guns in the hunting department, he asked the clerk where the antidepressants were.</p>
<p>October 3: Darted around the store suspiciously while, loudly humming the, 'Mission Impossible' theme.</p>
<p>October 6: In the auto department, he practiced his, 'Madonna Look' using different sizes of funnels.</p>
<p>October 18: Hid in a clothing rack and when people browsed through, yelled 'PICK ME! PICK ME!'</p>
<p>October 22: When an announcement came over the loud speaker, he assumed a fetal position and screamed;</p>
<p>'OH NO! IT'S THOSE VOICES AGAIN!'</p>
<p>Took a box of condoms to the checkout clerk and asked where is the fitting room</p>
<p>And last, but not least:</p>
<p>October 23: Went into a fitting room, shut the door, waited awhile; then yelled very loudly, 'Hey! There's no toilet paper in here.'<br>
One of the clerks passed out.</p>
