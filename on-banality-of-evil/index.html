				<h1>On banality of evil</h1>
<ul>
<li>Eichmann needed no great evil intention. He was thoughtless going along. He was not stupid, just someone who willingly suspended moral compass.</li>
<li>Proportionality bias - the misconception that for something to have large consequences it must also have a proportionally large cause.</li>
<li>Ethical fading - consider an action in terms of its remuneration, disregarding moral dimensions.</li>
<li>In ordinary circumstances, an agent’s intentions can diminish blameworthiness. Yet in some cases, especially those where the actions under consideration puncture the fabric of our moral universe, intentions cannot mitigate blame, as in the case of Eichmann.</li>
<li>She emphasizes that it is the duty of citizens to be critical, to ask questions, and to behave with recalcitrance when power’s intentions are malevolent.</li>
<li>It is inconceivable that every Nazi bureaucrat was an evil individual motivated by the prospect of genocide. Eichmann, for Arendt, provided a counter-example to this view she thought was reductive.</li>
<li>Spilling coffee on a coworker as a premeditated, thought out action to ruin their day vs spilling coffee on them in the heat of a serious argument is a difference in <em>malice</em>. What makes an evil act &quot;banal&quot; is not that it was accidental, it's that the evil act was done despite the fact that the actor wasn't particularly malicious.</li>
<li>The point she brings out is that specific kinds of speech can substitute for a complete thought. Eichmann had &quot;winged words&quot; that he used to stop thinking fully, and propaganda generally served that purpose.</li>
