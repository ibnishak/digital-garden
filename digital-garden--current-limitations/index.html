				<h1>Digital Garden: Current Limitations</h1>
<h3>Digital garden is more dependant on search.</h3>
<p>Blog navigation is simpler, because of fewer posts and date wise sorted list. By its nature, digital garden takes you from one post to another in quick succession. A curated homepage can list only a limited number of links, and a reader cannot be expected to remember entirety of path traversed to reach a post.</p>
<p><em>Solution</em>: Ideal solution would be a fuzzy launcher like fzf.  Existing javascript equivalents of fzf seems sub-par, especially given that number of posts in digital garden would be considerably bigger than that of a blog. Someone serious about their digital garden might run a server that will solve this issue with appropriate backend. However for the static site crowd, no solutions are available so far.</p>
<h3>Updates to post are not visible.</h3>
<p>Given that most posts continuously evolve, and mosts posts are out of sight of main index, there should be a way to stay up-to-date with changes.</p>
<p><em>Solution</em>: RSS feeds. Separate feeds for new notes and changes to existing notes. Possibly a running log of changes in the home page.</p>
<h3>Less dependable.</h3>
<p>Since posts are published before it is completely refined and that it may change anytime, it might undermine reader's ability to trust the written word.</p>
<p><em>Solution</em>: Tags indication the level of note - draft, half-done, finished etc.</p>
<p>PS: Not all digital gardens need be published. I am perfectly happy keeping two. Also most of the limitations mentioned above are only applicable to the visitor. I have superpowers called fzf, ripgrep, fd and vscode.</p>
