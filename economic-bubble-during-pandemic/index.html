				<h1>Economic Bubble During Pandemic</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Share prices is expected to rise if a company cuts its wage bill. This explains rise of stock market during corona pandemic. Demand may have declined but profit was not impacted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Corporates cannot sustain this contraction of economy for long. Sustained decline in demand caused by waning disposable household income would catch them soon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a result corporates would be saddled with unsold goods, leading to drop in prices, revenue and stock prices in turn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People get so excited by the idea of making a profit that they forget in March 2020 alone, Indian stock market had tanked a fourth of its capitalisation causing mayhem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A week of turbulence eroded over 1 lakh crore in market capitalisation in case of just six companies of Adani group. For an individual investor who has purchased these shares during the month before that, this means he pl list his entire investment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The present surge in Indian stock market is nudging effect in display. Daniel Kahneman argues that humans usually use the 'first system' or fast thinking to hurriedly act and perceive their environment. Consequently, they are susceptible to priming effect, framing bias, anchoring effect, overconfidence bias and availability heuristic.</p>
