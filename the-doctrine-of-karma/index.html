				<h1>The doctrine of karma</h1>
<p>Karma denotes a belief that one's place in life is determined by one's deeds in previous lifetimes. According to this, if you do evil things in this life, you will be born in a lower caste in your next birth and vice versa. On the surface this might seem like a exhortion to do good deeds. However in reality, this doctrine is popularised to justify the caste system in Hinduism. It carries the message that if you are born in lower caste, it is because you were an evil person in the past lifetime. Thus it warns against rebelling against the injustice of being forced to servitude just because you were born in lower caste, and instead of blaming the system, you only have yourselves to blame.</p>
<p>Also to be noted what &quot;good deed&quot; means according to the doctrine of karma. The varna system assigns duties to each caste as follows: Brahmins are teachers and priests, Kshatriya are warriors and rulers, Vaishya are merchants and Shudra are servants. A &quot;good deed&quot; according to caste system is limited to the duty assigned to your caste. A Kshatriya refusing to wage war is committing a sin by not performing the duty assigned to him. Same is the case when a Vaishya performs teaching.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One should not abandon duties born of one’s nature, even if one sees defects in them, O son of Kunti. Indeed, all endeavors are veiled by some evil, as fire is by smoke. - Bhagvad Gita, Chapter 18, Verse 48</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is far better to discharge one's prescribed duties, even though they may be faulty, than another's duties. Destruction in the course of performing one's own duty is better than engaging in another's duties, for to follow another's path is dangerous. - Bhagvad Gita, Chapter 3, Verse 35</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong>:  It justifies injustice, and deflects hopes for progress from this life to a “next life”. For the people on top of the caste system (the Brahmins), reincarnation justifies why they get the privilege of high-class birth.</p>
