				<h1>Cross referencing in Zettelkasten</h1>
<p>Links in zettelkasten could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>A link to a more general idea. If you’re writing about the diet of guinea pigs you might link to the nutritional requirements of rodents in general.</li>
<li>A link to a more specific idea. Here you could link to protein requirements of guinea pigs.</li>
<li>A related topic. This could be a lateral leap — guinea pigs as pets, alternate meanings of “guinea pig”, an article on “is a guinea pig a pig?”</li>
</ul>
<p>You can ask yourselves - if I am to write an essay on this topic, what points are missing? Then write those notes and link it.</p>
