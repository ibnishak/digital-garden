				<h1>Natural distribution</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>‘The natural distribution is neither just nor unjust; nor is it unjust that persons are born into society at some particular position. These are simply natural facts. What is just and unjust is the way that institutions deal with these facts.’ ― Rawls, A Theory of Justice</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Blaming the situation of poor and downtrodden on an anthropomorphised nature is a convienient way for the oppressors to wash their hands off it. A similar attempt can be seen in <a href="the-doctrine-of-karma">the doctrine of karma</a>.</p>
