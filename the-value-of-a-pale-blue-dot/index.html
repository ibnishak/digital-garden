				<h1>The value of a pale blue dot</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known. - Carl Sagan</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everything we have ever created and everyone we ever loved exist in this earth. Yet we show no remorse in being laid-back in its preservation. When large conglomerates get away with an oil-spill or carcinogenic dump that salts the earth for generations, how is it that our blood is not boiling? When we take pride in the unchecked industrial growth and derive patriotic glee from it, we need to remind ourselves of the insignificance of national boundaries and made up divisions.</p>
