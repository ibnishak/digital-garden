                    <h1>A world wide survey was conducted by UN</h1>
<p>A worldwide survey was conducted by the UN.<br>
The only question asked was: &quot;Would you please give your honest opinion about solutions to the food shortage in the rest of the world&quot;<br>
The survey was a huge failure.</p>
<p>In Africa they didn't know what &quot;food&quot; meant.<br>
In Eastern Europe they didn't know what &quot;honest&quot; meant.<br>
In Western Europe they didn't know what &quot;shortage&quot; meant.<br>
In China they didn't know what &quot;opinion&quot; meant.<br>
In the Middle East they didn't know what &quot;solution&quot; meant.<br>
In South America they didn't know what &quot;please&quot; meant.<br>
And in the USA they didn't know what &quot;the rest of the world&quot; meant.</p>
