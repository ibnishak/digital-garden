				<h1>CIA vs FBI vs KGB</h1>
<p>The CIA, the FBI, and the KGB are all trying to prove that they are the best at apprehending criminals. They are given a test. A rabbit gets released into a forest and each one has to catch it.</p>
<p>The CIA goes in. They place animal informants throughout the forest. They question all plant and mineral witnesses. After three months of extensive investigations, they conclude that rabbits do not exist.</p>
<p>The FBI goes in. After two weeks with no leads they burn the forest, killing everything in it and make no apologies about it. The rabbit had it coming.</p>
<p>The KGB goes in. They come out two hours later dragging a badly beaten and tortured bear. The bear is screaming, &quot;YES, YES! I'm a RABBIT!! I'm a RABBIT!!&quot;</p>
