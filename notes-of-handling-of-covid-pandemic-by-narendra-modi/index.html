				<h1>Notes of handling of COVID pandemic by Narendra Modi</h1>
<ul>
<li>Government of India allows private sector to buy 25% of all vaccines produced and sell them at 7-8 fold price.
<ul>
<li>Private hospitals being concentrated on urban areas, this means rich urban elites have easier access to vaccine. This divide is accentuated by largely technology driven solutions to get registered for vaccines in government facilities, which might not be accessible to poor and marginalised classes of society.</li>
<li>Private sector has capabilities to serve 3-4% vaccination eligible population through their facilities. Even if they ramp up using campus vaccination drives, it would go up to 10%. Allocating 25% to them is wastage and depriving public sector of vaccines.</li>
<li>When 1/4th of vaccines are paid for at an 8 fold price, the average price of vaccine becomes 2 fold. At which point government can no longer claim that it is a free vaccination drive. It is paid for well over the price by people, and governement is profiting from this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In all, 66 million vaccine doses were exported, while Indiaâ€™s entire vaccine programme over three months from mid-January to mid-April has given 130 million doses. Now India has gone from being a vaccine exporter, to needing vaccine imports, including the Russian Sputnik vaccine, U.S. developed Johnson and Johnson, Moderna and Pfizer and others. It is in the interest of the world that we manage our pandemic. Had those vaccines put to use in India, it could have saved a lot of Indians in the second wave, and saved us money.</li>
</ul>
