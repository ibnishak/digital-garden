				<h1>Confirmation bias</h1>
<p>Whenever observations contradicted one's theory, we should take them very seriously and note them down immediately. Brain actively “forgets” disconfirming evidence after a short time. The more correct one judge his theory to be, the more actively one should looked for contradictions.</p>
