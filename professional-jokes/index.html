<p>A physicist, an engineer, and a statistician went out hunting.</p>
<p>The physicist calculates the trajectory using ballistic equations, but assumes no air resistance, so his shot falls 5 meters short.</p>
<p>The engineer adds a fudge factor for air resistance, and his shot lands 5 meters long.</p>
<p>The statistician yells &quot;We got 'em!</p>
<hr>
<p>A farmer has a problem with foxes eating his hens. So he asks his physicist friend to help find a solution.</p>
<p>The physicist spends a day thinking, then replies</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I've found a solution, but it will only work for spherical chickens in a vacuum&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>A recent finding by statisticians shows the average human has one breast and one testicle.&quot;</p>

<p>Engineers from IBM, Apple, and Microsoft were attending a tech conference. They met at the queue to the toilet by chance in-between talks.</p>
<p>The Engineer from IBM took a leak, washed his hands, and dried his hands with about 20 sheets of paper towels. He said to the other two &quot;At IBM, we are very thorough&quot;, then left to conference hall.</p>
<p>The engineer from Apple pissed, washed his hands, then dried it with one sheet of paper towel, making sure he used every millimeter of the towel. &quot;At Apple, we are efficient&quot;, he quipped to the Microsoft engineer before returning to the conference hall.</p>
<p>The Microsoft engineer did the number one, then directly went to the hall, muttering to himself &quot;at Microsoft, we don't piss on our goddamn hands&quot;.</p>
