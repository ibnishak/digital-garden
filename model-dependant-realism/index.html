				<h1>Model dependant realism</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>According to model-dependent realism, it is pointless to ask whether a model is real, only whether it agrees with observation. If there are two models that both agree with observation â€¦ then one cannot say that one is more real than another. One can use whichever model is more convenient in the situation under consideration</p>
