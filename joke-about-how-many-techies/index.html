				<h1>Joke about how many techies</h1>
<p>How many Microsoft employees does it take to change a lightbulb<br>
None, they just declare darkness the new standard.</p>
<p>How many apple enthusiasts does it take to change a light bulb<br>
They don't change the light bulb, they just buy a new house.</p>
<p>How many Linux users does it take to change a lightbulb?<br>
One, but he'll take a weekend to rewire half the basement, constantly promising that you'll never need to change a lightbulb again. When he's done, it only lights up if you flip the switch in a certain way, and it's somehow Microsoft's fault when it doesn't.</p>
<p>How many graphic designers does it take to change a lightbulb<br>
I'm not changing a thing.</p>
<p>How many software engineers does it take to screw in a light bulb<br>
None. It's a hardware problem.</p>
