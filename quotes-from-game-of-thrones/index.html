                    <h1>Quotes from Game of thrones</h1>
<p>“This is old news, and stale,” growled the Shavepate.</p>
<p>“Your mother said the same of your father’s kisses,” Daario replied.</p>
<hr>
<p>Big Bucket laughed in his face. &quot;Lord Pea Pod if you were a man, I would kill you for that, but my sword is made of too fine steel to besmirch with craven's blood.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>&quot;What you suggest is treason&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Only if we lose&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>Tyrion: &quot;Littlefinger is a liar&quot;</p>
<p>Cersei: &quot;And black, said the raven of the crow&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>Kasporio: &quot;Will you want a pig to ride as well?&quot;</p>
<p>Tyrion: &quot;Why, I did not know your wife was in the company. So kind of you to offer her, but I would prefer a horse.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>&quot;Salzella shrugged. &quot;We've got to do this properly. Did you know Dr Undershaft was strangled before he was hung?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hanged&quot;, said Bucket, without thinking. &quot;Men are hanged. It's dead meat that's hung&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed?&quot; said Salzella. &quot;I appreciate the information. Well, poor old Undershaft was strangled, apparently. And then he was hung.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>Janos Slynt: &quot;Are you drunk?! If you think I will sit here and have my honor questioned- &quot;</p>
<p>Tyrion Lannister: &quot;I am not questioning your honor, Lord Janos. I am denying its existence.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>“We’ll defend the Wall to the last man,” said Cotter Pyke.</p>
<p>“Probably me,” said Dolorous Edd, in a resigned tone.</p>
<hr>
<p>Roose Bolton: &quot;Don't make me rue the day I raped your mother.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>&quot;I never win anything,&quot; Dolorous Edd complained. &quot;The gods always smiled on Watt, though. When the wildlings knocked him off the Bridge of Skulls, somehow he landed in a nice deep pool of water. How lucky was that, missing all those rocks?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Was it a long fall?&quot; Grenn wanted to know. &quot;Did landing in the pool of water save his life?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Dolorous Edd. &quot;He was dead already, from that axe in his head. Still, it was pretty lucky, missing the rocks.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>Edmure: &quot;You will never know how sick it makes me to see you in this room, Kingslayer. You will never know how much I despise you.&quot;</p>
<p>Jaime: &quot;I have been despised by better men than you, Edmure.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>Kevan is my favorite Lannister. But that's like saying lung is my favorite cancer, so, you know.</p>
<hr>
<p>Melisandre: He is Azor Ahai come again, born amidst salt and smoke.</p>
<p>Renly: What is he, a ham?</p>
<hr>
<p>Tyrion: &quot;Bronn, Timmet, the next time Ser Boros opens his mouth, kill him.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>Lysa Arryn: You do not fight with honor!</p>
<p>Bronn: &quot;No, milady. [gestures to the moon door that Ser Vardis Egen's corpse fell through] - He did.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>There's no cure for being a cunt</p>
<hr>
