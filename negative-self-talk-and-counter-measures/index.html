				<h1>Negative self-talk and counter measures</h1>
<ul>
<li>Personalizing: Everybody is mad at me, They do not like me etc
<ul>
<li>Is it factual or my interpretation of the event?</li>
<li>Is there solid evidence to support my view?</li>
<li>What alternative explanations are there for the event?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Filtering: See only negative aspects of a day or event
<ul>
<li>Interstitial journal: Keep a record of everything you do n few words, immediately. At the end of day, you can see the positives too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Catastrophising: Anticipate the worst.
<ul>
<li>Ask yourselves: How likely is this to happen?</li>
<li>Distinguish between uncomfortable outcomes vs. catastrophic outcomes.</li>
<li>Can a stalled train actually stay stuck for decades? And, if it doesn't, wouldn’t you still be okay in the long run?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Polarizing: It’s the feeling that you have to be perfect or you’re a total failure
<ul>
<li>If you don’t do something perfectly, reassure yourself that you’re only human. You’re allowed to make choices that cater to your needs at the moment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
