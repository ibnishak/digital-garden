<p>People prefer immediate rewards in the short-term over better rewards in the long-term.</p>
<h2>Use</h2>
<p>Frame your message in such a way that its effects are seen in shortest possible time. Egs</p>
<ul>
<li>Rather than go with “Shed 10 kgs in 60 days”, try “Burn 1000 calories today, so that you don’t have to burn extra calories tomorrow.”</li>
<li>Instead of saying “You’ll likely get lung cancer in 5 years”, we can reframe like “Every cigarette you smoke, makes it that much harder for you to quit.”</li>
<li>Instead of saying, you’ll save $20 dollars by buying our yearly subscription of $100. We can try reframing it by saying - “You only pay $8.40 this month instead of $10.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>Counter</h2>
<p>Think in <a href="second-order-thinking">second order</a>.</p>
