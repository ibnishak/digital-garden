                    <h1>Annual animal football game</h1>
<p>At their annual football game, the big animals are really trouncing the little animals with a tremendous offensive game. At half time the score is 33 to 0, and it’s only with considerable effort that the little animals manage to stop the opposition’s kickoff return on the twenty-two yard line. On the first down, the big animals send the hippopotamus around the right end, but as soon as he gets to the line of scrimmage-Bang!-he’s stopped cold.</p>
<p>Back in the huddle, the squirrel, the captain of the little animals, says, “Say, that was great! Who stopped the hippo, anyway?”</p>
<p>“Me,” says the centipede.</p>
<p>On the second down, the rhino charges around the left end, but he, too, is stopped cold at the line of scrimmage.</p>
<p>‘Terrific,” cheers the squirrel. “Who did it this time?”</p>
<p>“Me,” says the centipede.</p>
<p>On the third down the big animals send the elephant right up the middle, but he doesn’t get one yard before he’s knocked flat on his back.</p>
<p>“Was that you again?” asks the squirrel of the bug.</p>
<p>“Yup,” says the centipede modestly.</p>
<p>“Well, where the hell were you during the first half?” demands the squirrel.</p>
<p>“Taping my ankles.”</p>
