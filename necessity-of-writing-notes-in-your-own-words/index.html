				<h1>Necessity of writing notes in your own words</h1>
<ul>
<li>If you are forced to write, you are forced to clarify your thoughts (tacit knowledge to explicit knowledge). Unless you have clarity regarding your thoughts,
<ul>
<li>you cannot communicate effectively.</li>
<li>check validity of your thoughts and new ideas.</li>
<li>resist being brainwashed by fauxlosophical trapeze artists.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“The reason for writing is simple. Through writing you will learn what you think and you will come to know yourself. Write to find out what you think. Unless you know what you think, you will always be subject to the will of others.” –Deborah J. Haynes, in Art Lessons: Meditations on the Creative Life</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Note taking, if done intentionally, will allow find the differences and contradictions between the philosophy you believe you hold in your conscious mind, while actually follow unconsciously in real life.</li>
