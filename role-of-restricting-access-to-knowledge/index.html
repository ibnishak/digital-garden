				<h1>Role of restricting access to knowledge</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Typically, only a fully initiated elder would know and understand the entire knowledge system of the community. By keeping critical information sacred and restricted, the so-called ‘Chinese whispers effect’ could be avoided, protecting information from corruption.  <a href="https://getpocket.com/explore/item/this-ancient-mnemonic-technique-builds-a-palace-of-memory" target="_blank" class="external-link" rel="noopener">Source</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Is it an ethical stand? Shouldn't knowledge be free and available to all?</li>
<li>Is it only relevant to oral traditions?</li>
</ul>
<p>The wisdom of elders comes from the ability to see the system from a higher ground. Where everybody is blinded by chaos, they can see the pattern. More than merely acquiring knowledge, one should detach and reflect on it.</p>
