				<h1>Necessity of debates</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Polarized opinions mean topics matter enough for people to care. Healthy debate contributes to identifying weaknesses and fueling growth, while indifference would let it stagnate and die. - Sarah Dayan</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Not all topics deserve a debate. There are black and white matters.</li>
<li>Not everyone debates in good faith. Healthy debate requires honesty about one's own failures and humility to reflect. In reality, that rarely happens.</li>
<li>Raging debates confuse young and inexperienced.</li>
<li>People who take sides without understanding nuances of each arguments end up pushing for extremes.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>'Empathise with stupidity and you're halfway to thinking like an idiot,' muttered the woman, still not looking at Horza.  - Iain Banks</p>
