				<h1>Systemic racism in India</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Religion remains an important axis of discrimination in India.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As per NSS 68th round report of National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) on ‘Employment and Unemployment Situation Among Major Religious groups in India’, House that Hindus and Christians have a worker-population ratio of 41 and 41.9 respectively, for Buddhists the figure is 43.1, for Sikhs it is 36.3 while for Jains it is 35.5. For Muslims the figure was lowest at 32.6.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The census figures are in line with the report of the Sachar Committee that was set up by the UPA government to assess the status of Indian Muslims. The committee had found that the government sector employs 23.7% Muslims while the private sector about 6.5%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mob lynching incidents in the name of cow vigilantism, targeting Muslim youth under the bogey of “love jihad” and low-scale communal riots in various parts of the country. There are also credible studies showing the denial of housing to Muslims in non-Muslim localities, aggravating the process of ghettoisation of the community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under-representation of Muslim minorities in the Indian parliament after 2014 has now reached an all-time low. On parameters like literacy rates, mean years of schooling, the percentage of graduates, Muslims, Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes lag behind upper caste Hindus, Hindu OBCs and other religious minorities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The empirical data provided by the Post-Sachar Evaluation Committee Report (2014), Report of the Expert Group on Diversity Index (2008), India Exclusion Report (2013-14), 2011 Census and latest NSSO reports suggest that Indian Muslims are a socio-economically backward community.</p>
