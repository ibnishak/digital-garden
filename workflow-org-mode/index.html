				<h1>Workflow: Org mode and Orgzly</h1>
<p>More than org-mode, I use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orgzly&amp;hl=en_IN&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" class="external-link" rel="noopener">Orgzly</a>, the android app for org-mode. It can save the data in org files which are plain-text. These org files are synced to my computer using syncthing and processed in Emacs. Only the following files are managed this way.</p>
<ul>
<li>Inbox: It holds 2 kinds of data
<ul>
<li>Thoughts that pop into my head which I want to follow up later</li>
<li>Usually when I read an article on web, I highlight interesting parts with hypothesis. However since I am using firefox which does not have an official hypothesis addon, some articles won't open in hypothesis. In that case I copy/share the relevant highlights to inbox</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Watch/Read/Software/Golang: These four files are buckets for collecting links.</li>
<li>Shopping list.</li>
<li>TODO List.</li>
<li>Projects. Currently active project gets a separate file. All others are kept in this file. Whenever I come across an idea or link or tutorial that will help with anyone of the projects in back-burner, I add them here under their outline. It also acts as a record of my brainstorms, reasoning behind my decisions relating to that project, etc.</li>
<li>Current Project</li>
</ul>
<p>I am neither very diligent nor an outrageous slack when it comes to processing these files. However from time to time there comes a situation where one of these files become larger than my liking. In such situations I move them to a different folder after attaching current date to its name.</p>
