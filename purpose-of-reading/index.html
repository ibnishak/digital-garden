				<h1>Purpose of reading</h1>
<p>World around us can be only understood via models. The purpose of reading is to give you more models, or improve existing one to more accurately understand reality. Without an accurate understanding, we will fail to make good decisions.</p>
<p>It is for the same reason we should try to read books that does not conform with our thought patterns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“‘Read 500 pages every day. That’s how knowledge works. It builds up like compound interest. All of you can do it, but I guarantee not many of you will do it,’ says Warren Buffett<br>
It is not about the number of books read in a year. What matters is the knowledge absorbed from the and the change they introduced in your life. “The smarter you get, the slower you read.’ Naval Ravikant<br>
“Books give you access to the smartest brains on our planet. And learning from the greatest thinkers and doers is your fast track to health, wealth, and wisdom.” by Eva Keiffenheim</p>
