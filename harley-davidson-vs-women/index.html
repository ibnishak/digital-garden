                    <h1>Harley Davidson vs Women</h1>
<p>The inventor of the Harley Davidson Motorcycle Corporation, Arthur Davidson, died and went to heaven. At the gates, St. Peter told Arthur, &quot;Since you've been such a good man and your motorcycles have changed the world, your reward is you can hang out with anyone you want in Heaven.&quot; Arthur thought about it for a minute and then said, &quot;I want to hang out with God.&quot; St. Peter took Arthur to the Throne Room, and introduced him to God.</p>
<p>Arthur then asked God, &quot;Hey, aren't you the inventor of woman?&quot;</p>
<p>God said, &quot;Ah, yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Arthur, &quot;professional to professional, you have some major design flaws in your invention:</p>
<p>There's too much inconsistency in the front-end protrusion.</p>
<p>It chatters constantly at high speeds.</p>
<p>Most of the rear ends are too soft and wobble too much.</p>
<p>The intake is placed way too close to the exhaust.</p>
<p>And the maintenance costs are outrageous.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hmmmm, you may have some good points there,&quot; replied God, &quot;hold on.&quot; God went to his Celestial super computer, typed in a few words and waited for the results. The computer printed out a slip of paper and God read it.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it may be true that my invention is flawed,&quot; God said to Arthur, &quot;but according to these numbers, more men are riding my invention than yours.&quot;</p>
