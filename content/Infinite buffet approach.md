# Infinite buffet approach

Life is a buffet with infinite choices. In the initial stage, one must explore rapidly. After a while, one must revisit the best out of choices tested hitherto. While choices are infinite, our time and tummy space is finite. After this stage one must split their time to revisiting best out of known choices and exploring further. The ratio of time will keep tilting towards former but one must take care not to tip over.
