## Rigged Game Of Monopoly

In a series of behavioral experiments centered on the game of Monopoly conducted at the UC Berkeley campus — involved the secret recording of multiple “rigged” games of monopoly in which one random player in a group was given certain advantages such as: twice the money, greater ability to move around the board (more than two dice!), and more access to resources (higher bonuses for passing ‘go’).

The goal here was to study how “a privileged player in a rigged game behaves”. After just fifteen minutes of play for each game, the researchers began noticing behavioral changes in the advantaged players - ranging from louder, more forceful movement of their game piece (and other “displays of power”) to seemingly trivial things like eating more pretzels.

In one humorously shocking example, one of the advantaged players, after successfully winning the game, was heard explaining what he had done, strategically, to succeed and win. He could rationalize that his win was due to his own actions. This example speaks to how we make sense of advantage.
