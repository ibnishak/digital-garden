title: Self certify your achievments
---

Whenever you achieve something, cut out a piece of paper (5cm x 5cm), doodle something in it, write down your achievement with date and stick it on a wall. Helps in those "I hate myself phases"

## Rules
- Your own achievements. Not happy memories involving others. 
  - People are complicated. Relationships can go sour and those happy memories could become bitter. You want a pick me up during low moods, not pangs.
- Context specific. Achievements made at home - on a wall at home. Achievements at work - on a wall at work.

## What if there is no wall?
- In a book or diary?
