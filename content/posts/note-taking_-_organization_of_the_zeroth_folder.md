In my home directory, I have a folder named `0` which is mirrored between Linux and Android using Syncthing. It is named so that it appears first in lists and is easy to `cd` into. Under `~/0` there is:

Two Obsidian vaults.

1. Think box
   - For thinking, deliberating opinions, and questioning myself
   - Daily routines and situational routines, mental models.
   - Notes on people.
   - Collection(subfolder): poems, words, phrases and other things I collect.
   - Managing my lists (from ranked list of atrocities committed by governments to alphabetically sorted list of friends I would prefer as neighbors).
   - Highlights from Books (Moon reader) and Articles (Scrap bee).
   - Workflows, Criteria
   - Links to Resources.
   - Tutorials
   - Reviews.
2. Academic – Personal Medical Wikipedia.

In addition, I have five more folders.

1. Intake – Everything in pre-processed stage.
2. Accessories – images, videos, some zsh scripts pertaining to note-taking workflow, part of Obsidian configs, HTML files downloaded by Scrap bee. See [Notes on Accessories Folder](notes_on_accessories_folder)
3. Code snippets. This is the base folder for [navi][1]
4. Trackers: Mostly JSON from Nomie, some Excel sheets. Converted to graphs which is stored in Accessories folder.

I am not a huge favorite of splitting notes. However overtime I have found that these three areas have very little overlap[^1]. Splitting this way also helps me to monitor the growth of these three areas separately, however crude a measure that may be.

Within these vaults, I do not usually divide notes into folders. I found that creating index files is far more flexible than folders. In addition, I like the simplicity of linking by wrapping with double brackets without worrying about the paths. While Obsidian has magic configs that allow this even if the notes are in a separate folder, taking that route will restrict me to Obsidian.
