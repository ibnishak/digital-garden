> Wandering around the web is like living in a world in which every doorway is actually one of those science fiction devices which deposit you in a completely different part of the world when you walk through them. - Douglas Adams

- We revisit handful of webpages.
- We need serendipity engines - like search engines.
  - Wikipedia, Zettelkasten, StumbleUpon etc are serendipity engines.
- Aggregators have overpowered serendipity engines because we find comfort in [Confirmation bias](confirmation_bias).
- Our imagination is limited by our experiences. Since imagination leads to queries, we need to expose ourselves to varied experiences to push our imagination. See [Infinite Buffet](infinite_buffet)
