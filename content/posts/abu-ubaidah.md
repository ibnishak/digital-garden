# Abu Ubaidah ibn Jarrah

- First migrated to Absynnea and then from there to Medina
- His father ended up dying by his hands at the battle of Badr. Allah consoled him with the verse: "You will not find any people who believe in Allah and the Last Day loving those who resist Allah and His Messenger, even though they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred. For such he has written faith in their hearts and strengthened them with a spirit from Himself." (58:22)
- Was one of the defenders of Propher SAW at battle of Uhud. Was the one who removed the chain from Prophet's face.
- He heard the Prophet saying when he was breaking the rocks that hindered the progress of work: "Allah is the greatest, I have been given the keys of Syria, Persia and Yemen."
- "Every Ummah has a trustworthy man; Abu 'Ubaidah is the trustworthy man of this Ummah." - Prophet SAW said this while sending Abu Ubaidah to Najran to collect their Jizya.
- Abu Bakr Siddiq RA appointed Khalid ibn Walid as the Commander of Army, Umar ibn Khattab as Chief Justice and Abu Ubaidah as the Chief Treasurer
