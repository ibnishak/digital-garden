title: US Tariffs on India
---

- US imposed 25% tariffs on India for trade deficits and another 25% for buying oil from Russia.

## US-India geopolitics
- During India Pakistan wars, US has frequently sided with Pakistan - even sending them military aid during the 1971 war.[1]
  - During Kargil war, US diplomatically supported India[2]. Nevertheless, they denied use of GPS to India, prompting India to develop indigenous GPS system called NavIC[3].
- Trump family has crypto investments in Pakistan. Pakistan nominated Trump for Nobel peace prize.

## Hypocrisy
- US is a major importer of refined oil from India, which India imports from Russia. Over 90% of the Indian oil products imported by the U.S. came from the Reliance refinery, who gets nearly half its crude oil from Russia. [5]
- US has not imposed tariffs on China, who imports more oil from Russia than India.[6]

## Self reflection
- Is there a moral argument against buying Russian oil? Yes. But will moral arguments affect our survival where no one else follows such principles? Yes.
  - Again, during 71 war, US send Task Force 74 against India. It was USSR[7] who sent military aid to defend against that incursion.  

**Survival is the ultimate moral argument**.
