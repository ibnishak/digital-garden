1. Speak good or remain silent.
     - Prophet SAW said, ‘Whoever believes in God and the Last Day should **speak a good word or remain silent.**’
     - This is an exhortion to avoid unnecessarily criticising and engaging in debate. When one criticize or debate, one must #interrupt-your-thinking to ask if the subject is actually wrong and warrants a debate.
     - One should not remain silent when faced with wrong-doing
       - If someone among you sees wrong, he must right it by his hand if he can, if he cannot, then by his tongue, if he cannot, then by his gaze, and if he cannot, then in his heart. - Hadith 34, Hadith an-Nawawi
       - The best of jihad is a just word spoken to an unjust ruler.” - IbnMaja 4011
2. Refrain from Tit for Tat
     - “To refrain from imitation is the best revenge. — Marcus Aurelius, Meditations”
     - This is an exhortion to not hurt someone back the same way they hurt you.
     - One should always remember to imitate the good from whatever sources one can find. See tangent: [Guilt by Association in Ad hominem fallacy](ad_hominem)
3. Admit when you do not know.
     - When somebody asks something, interrupt your urge to answer. Do I really know this or am I giving my opinion?
4. Act without expectation of reciprocity
     - “The kindest act toward you in your life may come from an outsider not interested in reciprocation.” - Taleb
5. While it is important to be right, it is more important to be kind
