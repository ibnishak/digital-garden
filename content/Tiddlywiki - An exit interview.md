# Tiddlywiki - An exit interview

Fair warning: This is not a takedown. I am just explaining why to _my particular use-case_, Tiddlywiki is not a good fit anymore. In a way this is documentation of my [[Circle of Competence]] rather than limitation of Tiddlywiki. As a tool Tiddlywiki has persisted for 15+ years and earned praise from industry giants. So before dismissing it based on anyone's opinion, it would be only fair to give it a try.

For some years I have been noticing this pattern:

- I forget why I stopped using TW5.
- I restart using Tiddlywiki.
- I remember why I stopped
- Stop using TW5 again.

For this reason I am logging those reasons so I won't have to waste my time and energy finding the same things another couple of times.
