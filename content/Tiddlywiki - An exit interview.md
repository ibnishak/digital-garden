# Tiddlywiki - An exit interview

Fair warning: This is not a takedown. I am just explaining why to _my particular use-case_, Tiddlywiki is not a good fit anymore. In a way this is documentation of my [[Circle of Competence]] rather than limitation of Tiddlywiki. As a tool Tiddlywiki has persisted for 15+ years and earned praise from industry giants. So before dismissing it based on anyone's opinion, it would be only fair to give it a try.

On the other hand, I would ask the long-time Tiddlywiki users to stop and consider for a moment if Tiddlywiki is actually aiding expansion of their knowledge, or is it merely satisfying their urge to tinker with stuff. Also see [[Sunk Cost Fallacy]].

For some years I have been noticing this pattern:

- I forget why I stopped using TW5.
- I restart using Tiddlywiki.
- I realize why I stopped
- I stop using TW5 again.

For this reason I am logging those reasons so I won't have to use my time and energy to rediscover them another couple of times.

1. [[Tiddlywiki - Inability to scale]]

Usually if a tool fails to clear essential criteria of its category (See [[Note taking Apps - Criteria]]), I do not bother to look into it any further. Here I am making an exception, at least to document the rest of issues.

2. [[Tiddlywiki - Extensibility issues]]
3. [[Tiddlywiki - Issues with NodeJS flavor]]
4. [[Tiddlywiki - Issues with HTML flavor]]
5. [[Tiddlywiki - Issues with search]]
6. [[Tiddlywiki - Issues with markup]]
7. [[Tiddlywiki - Issues with UI, Community and the rest]]
8. [[Tiddlywiki - Conclusion]]
