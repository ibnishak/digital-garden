# Scalability Limits for Note taking Applications

Let us assume we take 20 notes per day all together - journal, snippets, bookmarks and all. 

- In a year, 7500 is a good approximation. 
- In 10 years, that becomes 75K. 
- Let us give it a comfortable blanket of 33% and we get a rounded number of 100K. 

In 10 years I hope to see significant upgrades in hardwares and softwares. So these are my arbitrary limits which I consider reasonable - I should be able to use my existing laptop to manage a personal knowledge base of **100K notes for the next 10 years**.
