# Diderot effect

The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption which leads you to acquire more new things. As a result, we end up buying things that our previous selves never needed to feel happy or fulfilled.

We are rarely looking to downgrade, to simplify, to eliminate, to reduce. Our natural inclination is always to accumulate, to add, to upgrade, and to build upon.

- **Reduce exposure**. Nearly every habit is initiated by a trigger or cue. One of the quickest ways to reduce the power of the Diderot Effect is to avoid the habit triggers that cause it in the first place. Unsubscribe from commercial emails. Call the magazines that send you catalogs and opt out of their mailings. Meet friends at the park rather than the mall.
- **Set self-imposed limits.** Live a carefully constrained life by creating limitations for you to operate within.
- **Go one month without buying something new**. Donâ€™t allow yourself to buy any new items for one month.

## Criticism
- It limits experiences.
