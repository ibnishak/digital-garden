- Set a timer and a single realistic goal. **A realistic goal = median of previous performances.**
  - See also [[Bayesian Thinking]]
- Get into [[Flow]] for that amount of time.
- Raise the counter and take a break.
  - [[Things to do while taking pomodoro breaks]].
- Update your data and probability of realistic goals.
