# Occams Razor

It advises that the simplest explanation is most likely to be true

A practical tactic is to look at your explanation of a situation, break it down into its constituent assumptions, and for each one, ask yourself: Does this assumption really need to be here? What evidence do I have that it should remain? Is it a false dependency?

## Occams Razor in medicine

- If all the symptoms of a patient is explained by
- one single disease
- 3 different diseases

opt for the former explanation.

- Contrast with [[Hickams dictum]]
