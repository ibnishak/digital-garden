# Need for Serendipity engines

> Wandering around the web is like living in a world in which every doorway is actually one of those science fiction devices which deposit you in a completely different part of the world when you walk through them. - Douglas Adams

- We revisit handful of webpages.
- We need serendipity engines - like search engines.
	- Wikipedia, Zettelkasten, StumbleUpon etc are serendipity engines. 
- Aggregators have overpowered serendipity engines because we find comfort in [[Confirmation bias]]. 
- Our imagination is limited by our experiences. Since imagination leads to queries, we need to expose ourselves to varied experiences to push our imagination. See [[Infinite Buffet]]
