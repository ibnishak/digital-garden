# Ad hominem

[Source][1]

Discusion of an idea or argument should be done completely independent of who or where it came from

Violations of this:
- Questioning the motivation: "You are paid to say that"
- Abuse: "You are a Nazi"
- Tu Quoque: "... but you do not follow it yourself."
	- Inability to follow a principle does not nullify the principle itself.
- Guilt by association: "This is exactly what Nazi's did."
	- Just because our argument aligns with a malefactor, does not mean all our arguments are invalid. Inorder to prove otherwise, one have to show that  deplorable arguments of the malefactor can be derived from this.
