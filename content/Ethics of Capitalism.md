# Ethics of Capitalism

Capitalism do not support liberty as a primary ethical value. Capitalism supports liberty because it aids them to generate more profit. If a condition arises where curtailing liberties of a population will help them generate more profit, capitalism will find no reason not to support that. Louis Vuitton during German occupation, Apple exploitation of Chinese children, slave supported economies etc
Towards this aim they are ready to exploit any loophole or sacifice any ethical position. For a company in capitalist society, failure to be this ruthless would mean some other company will overtake them using the same loophole.
