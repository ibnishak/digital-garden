# Note-taking – Organization of the Zeroth Folder

In my home directory, I have a folder named `0` which is mirrored between Linux and Android using Syncthing. It is named so that it appears first in lists and is easy to `cd` into. Under `~/0` there is:

Three Obsidian vaults.

1. Think box
   - For thinking, deliberating opinions, and questioning myself
   - Daily routines and situational routines, mental models.
   - Notes on people.
   - Managing my lists (from ranked list of atrocities committed by governments to alphabetically sorted list of friends I would prefer as neighbors).
   - Highlights from Books (Moon reader) and Articles (Scrap bee).
2. Digital Fortress
   - Workflows, Criteria
   - Links to Resources. 
   - Tutorials
   - Code snippets. See [[Workflow for Code Snippets]] #notYet
   - Reviews.
3. Academic – Personal Wikipedia.

In addition, I have five more folders.

1. Intake – Everything in pre-processed stage.
2. Accessories – images, videos, some zsh scripts pertaining to note-taking workflow, part of Obsidian configs, HTML files downloaded by Scrap bee. See [[Notes on Accessories Folder]]
3. Collection: poems, words, phrases and other things I collect.
4. Trackers: Mostly JSON from Nomie, some Excel sheets. Converted to graphs which is stored in Accessories folder.
5. Publish: A Hugo blog and a Gatsby blog. Ignored from Backup as it is pushed to GitHub which is a backup in itself. [[Workflow for Publishing Notes from Obsidian]] #notYet 

I am not a huge favorite of splitting notes. However overtime I have found that these three areas have very little overlap[^1]. Splitting this way also helps me to monitor the growth of these three areas separately, however crude a measure that may be.

Within these vaults, I do not usually divide notes into folders. I found that creating index files is far more flexible than folders. In addition, I like the simplicity of linking by wrapping with double brackets without worrying about the paths. While Obsidian has magic configs that allow this even if the notes are in a separate folder, taking that route will restrict me to Obsidian.

[^1]: Very little does not mean zero. For e.g. "List of FOSS alternatives" go to Digital Fortress, while "Ethics of FOSS" goes to Think Box. All the more reason to keep splits to minimum.
