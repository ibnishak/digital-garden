# Survivorship bias

- Social media and other information outlets only show individual successes. For every individual that succeeded, there might be 10 who failed. These 10 might have used the same technique, went to same coach and read the same self-help book.
  1. Since we only see successes around us, we overestimate our chance of success.
  2. A lot of success is pure chance. See [Meritocracy](meritocracy). While we should strive to succeed with all our might, we should also remind ourselves of this. It will help us retain humility in our successes, remind what we owe to the society.

## Counter

- Every time you hear a success story, remember those who used the same techniques and failed.
