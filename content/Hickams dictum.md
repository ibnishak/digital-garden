# Hickams dictum

patients can have as many diseases as they damn (or darn) well please

If all the symptoms of a patient is explained by
- a combination of 3 common diseases
- one rare disease

then weightage should be given to former explanation.

When you hear hoofbeats, think of horses, not zebra.
