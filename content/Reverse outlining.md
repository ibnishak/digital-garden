# Reverse outlining

Instead of writing an outline first and then writing the essay, write whatever that comes to mind, then add outline to see logical consistency, gaps etc

See [Flowstate App][1]

Instead to sitting down and planning every detail, just start working. After a while, look back and see what is missing.
