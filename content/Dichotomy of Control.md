# Dichotomy of Control

>There are things which are within our power, and there are things which are beyond our power. Within our power are opinion, aim, desire, aversion, and, in one word, whatever affairs are our own. Beyond our power are body, property, reputation, office, and, in one word, whatever are not properly our own affairs.â€” Epictetus, Enchiridion.

This is tricky and requires a lot of nuanced analysis of items.
- Growing old is out of our control but putting on weight is under our control. 
- The government inaction regarding something might be out of your control, but organizing protests and voting is still within your control. 
- Corporate greed disintegrating our social fabric is out of your control, but boycotting them creating a small dent in their bottomline is definitely within your control.
