# The Laundry Approach

Do you wash every single piece of clothes separately? I’m sure not. You simply wait until the whole bag is full and then do the laundry. Thus, here you can follow the same approach. Don’t keep yourself busy with checking out your emails the whole day long. You can do that once a day or once in 2 days, depends on their importance”
