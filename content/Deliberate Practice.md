# Deliberate Practice

**The right sort of practice carried out over a sufficient period of time leads to improvement. Nothing else. There is no such thing as natural talent or prodigies.**

## Components of purposeful practice:

-   Putting a bunch of baby steps together to hit a long term goal, having a plan
-   Feedback, you have to know whether you are doing something right and if not, what mistakes you’re making
-   Getting outside of your comfort zone, feeling uncomfortable. If you never push beyond your comfort zone you’ll never improve.
-   A way to monitor your progress
-   Maintaining motivation
-   You won’t improve much without giving the task your full attention (See Deep Work)
