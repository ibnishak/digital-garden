# Hyperbolic discounting

[Source][1]

People prefer immediate rewards in the short-term over better rewards in the long-term.

## Use
Frame your message in such a way that its effects are seen in shortest possible time. Egs
- Rather than go with “Shed 10 kgs in 60 days”, try “Burn 1000 calories today, so that you don’t have to burn extra calories tomorrow.”
- Instead of saying “You’ll likely get lung cancer in 5 years”, we can reframe like “Every cigarette you smoke, makes it that much harder for you to quit.”
- Instead of saying, you’ll save $20 dollars by buying our yearly subscription of $100. We can try reframing it by saying - “You only pay $8.40 this month instead of $10.” 

## Counter
Think in second order.
