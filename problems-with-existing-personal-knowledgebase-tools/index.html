                    <h1>Problems with existing personal knowledgebase tools</h1>
<ul>
<li>Searching is inefficient. There are fast grepping solutions available but I am yet to find one that can do a more context aware search. Searching for &quot;cricket milestones&quot; might bring up zero results, while searching for &quot;cricket&quot; and &quot;milestones&quot; separately will bring up irrelevant results.
<ul>
<li>#todo: Use an indexed searching mechanism.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are problems with search: you have to know to search for something, and you have to know how to search for it. In some cases this is an issue, in some it isn't. I have had many times over the years where I reviewed my notes and reminded myself of things I had completely forgotten. Search is useless in that case.</li>
<li>Physical zettelkasten has the advantage that notes.can be pulled out and  spatially arranged to give us insights. In digital version, this is limited by screen space, and scrolling somehow doesn't match the experience. However, digital zettelkasten has numerous advantages over physical one - including portability, backups, access to past revisions, and environment friendly.</li>
<li>The function of zettelkasten is to act as a second brain and thereby help us unload the brain. However unlike brain, zettelkasten does not automatically find link between existing ideas and the new ideas or notes you are adding to zettelkasten. May be the brand new brain spark you just had is merely a rewording of the one you had last month which you dutifully noted but forgot about. There are softwares like nvalt which try to tackle this, however they are limited by the technology of our time. For building a perfect zettelkasten, you need to hold the entire thing in your head, which runs counter to the philosophy of having a second brain. Next best solution would be emergence of powerful semantic search.</li>
