				<h1>Blog vs Digital Garden</h1>
<p>The major issue seems to be that of semantics. There is no universal definition of &quot;blog&quot;. However, most blogs we see have the following pattern.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most posts are essay-ish.</li>
<li>Posts are standalone. They might link to resources outside the blog itself.</li>
<li>Blog index pages are a time-stamped stream that is very RSS friendly.</li>
<li>Posts are published after a certain finality is achieved. It is more performative writing.</li>
</ul>
<p>In comparison, digital gardens are more like a personal mini Wikipedia.</p>
<ul>
<li>Length of posts vary between a tweet sized bit to a couple of paragraphs.</li>
<li>Posts are linked to each other. Other posts in digital garden either continue the conversation or are laterally related to current post. Most digital gardens also shows backlinks - those posts which link to the current post.</li>
<li>Digital garden has a curated home page.</li>
<li>Digital garden in more like a broadcast log of the knowledge acquired. It follows the philosophy of &quot;<a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu#:~:text=One%20of%20my%20favorite%20ways,from%20Robin%20Sloan%20(below).&amp;text=I%20love%20this%20kind%20of,followings%20over%20the%20long%20term." target="_blank" class="external-link" rel="noopener">working with your garage door open</a>&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, all these characteristics are arbitrarily distributed between blog and a digital garden. There is nothing preventing from having a blog with characters mentioned under digital garden category or vice versa.</p>
