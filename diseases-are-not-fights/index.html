				<h1>Diseases are not fights</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>I hope at least OCD and cancer are portrayed not as battles to be won or as symbolic manifestations of character flaws or whatever, but as illnesses to be lived with as well as one can. - John Greene, Anthropocene and Other essays</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does this romanticism surrounding crippling diseases negatively impact the average patient well being? A quiet normal life with the disease should be the pinnacle of living with the disease. The inspirational stories are good when it inspires. However it might also cause the patient to feel inadequate, compared with the hero. May be we should portrait them less as struggles and fights, more as an everyday reality.</p>
