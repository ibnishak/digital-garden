				<h1>Zettelkasten - What and Why</h1>
<p>Zettelkasten is a workflow used by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann" target="_blank" class="external-link" rel="noopener">Niklas Luhmann</a></p>
<p>A word about zettelkasten is warranted here. To me, zettelkasten is a workflow, rather than something tangible. It involves 3 steps</p>
<ol>
<li>Add interesting snippets to a temporary folder. Like inbox in GTD workflow.</li>
<li>Move notes from folder 1 to folder 2. This involves 2 conditions
<ol>
<li>Any snippets should be rewritten in your own words and elaborated. Quotes should also accompany your thoughts on that.</li>
<li>Link to other notes. Links could be to a more general note, more specific note or to a note parallel to current note. Categorization of notes is highly discouraged.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Move notes from folder 2 to folder 3 by coalescing small notes to a larger one. Folder 3 is called evergreen notes by <a href="https://twitter.com/soenke_ahrens?lang=en" target="_blank" class="external-link" rel="noopener">Sohnke Ahren</a>. It could also be your blog posts, personal knowledge base or webpage.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Why</h2>
<ol>
<li>Avoid <a href="collector-s-fallacy">Collector's fallacy</a></li>
<li>Knowledge to Wisdom</li>
</ol>
