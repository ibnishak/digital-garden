				<h1>Caste system</h1>
<h2>Mythology of origin</h2>
<p>According to the Rig Veda, the primal man, Purusha, destroyed himself to create a human society and the different parts of his body created the four different <em>varnas</em>. The Brahmins were from his head, the Kshatriyas from his hands, the Vaishyas from his thighs, and the Shudras from his feet. The Varna hierarchy is determined by the descending order of the different organs from which the Varnas were created.</p>
<h2>History of origin</h2>
<p>Historically, however, it is believed that the caste system began with the arrival of the Aryans in India around 1500 BC. Of the many cultures that flourished in India, the literary records of the Indo-Aryan culture are not the earliest. They do, however, contain the first mention and a continuous history of the factors that make up the caste system (Ghurye, 162-63).</p>
